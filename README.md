## **LuxDevHQ Code Of Conduct**

Abusing these guidelines may result in your removal from the community.

**1). No spammy behavior.**

- Light self-promotion is totally fine, but you can't constantly promote your business/podcast/etc. Participate organically!

- No straight-up marketing, please. Again, participate organically!

- No random links to non-community stuff (unless in designated channels)

**2). Keep it on-topic.**
- This is primarily a place for folks in the community world to talk all things community, with general chat okay in appropriate channels

- Top-level comments should be made in the appropriate channel; if an off-topic comment is posted it will be removed

**3). No hateful, racist, sexist, etc speech will be tolerated**
- This isn't difficult. You do it, you're banned.

**3). Use real names and companies.**
- Pseudonymous communities are great and have their placeâ€¦ This is a space for meeting others and building professional relationships, so real names and companies should be used

**4). Keep it above board**
- Don't post, share, or solicit illegal content

**5). Don't be a jerk**
- If you're found to be harassing or being a jerk to anyone else in our community, you're outta here

**6). No politics**
- We know that political discourse, especially now, is extremely important. This rule isn't meant to stifle beliefs or ideals, it's simply meant to avoid intense, heated political discussions in our community.

**7). This is not a marketplace**
- We're not here for you to sell things through our community.
